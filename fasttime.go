// other toolchain, and every Go release outside that window, takes the
// fasttime_zzz.go fallback instead, because a wrong offset can sit in an
// integer field, and dereferencing it to check it would fault during package
// init instead of disabling the fast path. Raise the upper bound only after
// checking the offsets against the new release.

// deliberately: the runtime finds g through a stash on the gsignal stack when
// a signal lands inside the vDSO, and this path only writes that stash when
// switching stacks, so such callers are routed through the now() fallback in
// walltime's callers instead, whose runtime implementation does its own stack
// switch and signal bookkeeping.
//
// Unlike the runtime this does not set m.vdsoPC/m.vdsoSP. Doing that would
// need two more hardcoded m offsets, and unlike the g0 offsets they could not
// be validated cheaply: a wrong one would corrupt runtime state instead of
// merely disabling the fast path. The cost is traceback fidelity if

// rejected without dereferencing it. Implemented per architecture.
//
// m.gsignal, which vdsoCallG0 also reads, is deliberately not checked: on a

// tell the two apart would fault during package init instead of disabling the

// ever needs the former.
//
// The read is done on the g0 stack because the kernel's clock_gettime may use

// can hit the guard page of a goroutine stack. It also has to run on g0 for the

// call to a body-less function costs 57 on its own, so calling now() here would
